Design Decisions: 

I choose to use JSON, a standard text-based format, as it is 
commonly used for transmitting data in web applications. 
JSON is easy to display or read from the client easily. I felt
this was the most extensible choice when choosing an input type.
Also, I am using the Strategy Pattern as this is well suited for
insurance pricing to use many different algorithms. This allows
the modularity to easily see that the pricer is considering
three factors.  If the program is a success this is easily scalable.
